Analysis of Credit Card Transactions to identify Fraud.

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). This dataset was created during a research collaboration between Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.

This dataset consists of 284,807 transactions made by European cardholders for two days in the month of September 2013. Out of the 284,807 transactions,492 (0.172%) are the fraudulent transactions making the dataset highly unbalanced.  There are no missing values in the dataset so no need to handle those.
